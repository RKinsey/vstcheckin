  Okay, so I haven't committed in a while. I'm currently trying to get css functioning on the site (the CSS formatting is correct, but I'm not sure why it doesn't actually show up) and had to make a few changes to the files so they'd work properly with upstart. I'll port the important changes to my home computer in the next couple of days.
